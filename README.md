# Speech Transcription Evaluation Sets for the Manx Language

These evaluation sets are collections of Manx Gaelic speech recordings, along with transcripts (written versions of what is spoken) and, where available, English translations. By providing this data, we hope to support researchers, developers, and language enthusiasts who want to improve tools and technologies related to the Manx language.

**Manx**  
Manx Gaelic (Gaelg) is a Celtic language spoken on the Isle of Man. Since experiencing a period of decline in recent centuries, the language has benefited from community-led revitalisation efforts and now continues to grow through educational programs, community events, and media. The data published in this repository could not exist without the extensive documentation efforts of community members who have worked to preserve and promote the language in recent years. Their contributions form the foundation upon which this work is built. 

## Why Make Evaluation Sets?

Manx language resources are extremely rare compared to most languages, which makes building language technologies challenging. These evaluation sets provide essential benchmarks to consistently measure and enhance the performance of various language technologies. They can be used for:

- **Testing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):**  
  Assess and refine tools that convert spoken Manx into written text.

- **Improving Text-to-Speech (TTS):**  
  Develop natural, fluent Manx voices, making the language more accessible.

- **Advancing Speech-to-Text (S2T) and Machine Translation (MT):**  
  Help machines understand and accurately translate spoken or written Manx.

- **Developing Spoken Language Identification (SpokenLID):**  
  Teach systems to recognise Manx, even in mixed-language audio.

## Overview of the Evaluation Sets

We have grouped our resources into four main sets. Each set focuses on a different style of Manx speech. For more details, visit each set’s README:

1. **"Loayrt Rish" (Conversations With)**  
   [View README](Loayrt_Rish/README.md)

2. **"Skeelyan Vannin" (Stories of Mann)**  
   [View README](Skeelyan_Vannin/README.md)

3. **"Ynsaghey" (Learn)**

4. **"Lioarlagh" (Books)**

## Licensing and Source Information

Please see the individual sets’ `README.md` files for details on their origins. All data in this repository has been sourced from publicly available sources, however we strive to respect original content creators and maintain any licensing conditions.

## How to Use These Sets

Clone or download this repository to access descriptions and transcripts. The audio files are too large to be hosted directly in this repository, so please contact me personally if you would like access to the recordings.

## Areas for Improvement

This repository is a work in progress. Here are some areas where contributions would be especially valuable:

* Additional Resources: Contributions of Manx text or audio recordings. Speech transcription data is preferable but unlabelled data can also prove useful.
* Formatting: Some transcriptions exist only in PDF format and need to be converted into machine-readable text formats.
* Correcting Errors: Whilst every effort had been made to ensure that language data is correct, some errors may persist.
* Testing and Feedback: Testing various models against these datasets for continuous improvement, of the models themselves but also of these data.

**Contributions**

We welcome contributions to improve this repository. If you have new resources, corrections, or suggestions, please feel free to submit a pull request or contact me directly at csjbartley1@sheffield.ac.uk.
