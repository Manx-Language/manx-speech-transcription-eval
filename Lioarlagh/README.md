**Description:**  
This set is composed of audiobook-style recordings sourced from Cillstore, featuring readings of various texts. The speech is generally high-quality, professionally recorded, and free from significant background noise. Texts tend to vary between religious texts and folklore. Manx transcriptions exist but most have not been translated. I am looking to expand this set with more contemporary audiobooks in the future.
