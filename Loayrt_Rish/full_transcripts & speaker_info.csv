I've been in the Alps and in Norway but that's it; I haven't been further than than. I don't like hot countries; Munich was hot enough for me, and Austria, and places like that. They were terribly hot. I couldn't go further south than that. Maybe, I'd like to see Italy and Spain and places like that but I'd probably have to go in the summer- not in the summer, in the winter because the summer is too hot for the Manx to be in places like that. We don't like the heat. But I like places in these islands , in Ireland, and Scotland, and Wales, and places like that. I especially like places where Celtic languages are still being spoken, and I've been in Ireland and Wales a few times."

When you were through the gate you weren't allowed to use English at all. And, I think, in English they call it 'total immersion'. That was the way to do it. That's the way. It's difficult to begin with, and I remember thinking, ""I can never do this."" Men came - Johnny Crellin and people like that - and they would speak to each other in Manx and I was- I remember thinking, ""I can never do that.

They're adults, not children, but they run about and jump on top of each other and they're all rolling about in the mud, and I don't understand that, why people do that.

I like lots of things about the Isle of Man: I like Manx cats, and loaghtan sheep, and everything. I don't like yellow houses; I have a sort of thing about yellow houses; they vex me. Everywhere you go there are yellow houses like piss, aren't they? I would rather white houses, or stone, like in olden times.","Well, I like the country, and I like that the Isle of Man is safe. I like walking on my own, and I feel safe all the time. I think it's a safe place. And I like looking at the beautiful views, and I like the sea; I can hear the sea from my house when the door is open, it's very good. What about I don't like? I don't like that it's difficult to visit my family in England. It's alright if all my family in England are O.K., but if there's any difficulty it's difficult to visit them without getting on the boat or the plane; it's not easy to go away and it's very expensive.

But now there are lot of people interested in Manx, there are a lot of people learning Manx at the moment, and years ago lots of people were against Manx because they couldn't speak it, I think, but they were all against it. ""You're wasting your time, it won't earn you a penny,"" and things like that, but they don't say thing like this, rubbish like this now.

It's great that the government thinks that Manx is important enough to give money to it, and it's great that people are using the money well, teaching children. It's great to see the kids from the Bunscoill using the language, just talking together in a basic way; that's very good.

Now there are thousands of them. It's great, it's really great. People come to my office sometimes and they speak Manx to me and I don't know them. Once a priest came in and he said, ""Can you call a taxi for me, please?"" and I said, ""Where are you going?"" ""Ramsey."" ""And where in Ramsey?"" ""To the square in Ramsey."" And I called and found out his name, and when he said the name I thought, ""I've heard of this man."" He was the minister in a Methodist church in Ramsey, he was learning Manx, and he had a strong English accent and wonderful Manx, and I thought, ""That's how it should be."" And the school in St Johns is doing great, the Bunscoill is doing great- the thing, what's it called? The primary school for those before they go to school. Mooinjer Veggey. Mooinjer Veggey doing great things. The music that uses Manx, lots of musicians. It's not just the language but everything, the dancing, the music, the language. It's much better that I ever thought it could be when I was learning Manx. It's wonderful, fella, wonderful. And a lot of work, done by yourself, and people like you who do a lot of things. At the start they said, ""This won't work, there won't be enough people learning Manx, there aren't enough"" and now there are plenty, even people who weren't thinking of using Manx are teaching people; they learned and now they're teaching people. Wonderful."

It's a shame they're not around because, without all the work they did there wouldn't be work like mine, so we are all grateful to them, definitely, for all their work, and as I said, it's a shame they aren't here today.

I am teaching, or I was teaching in the schools, and the best thing is that the children are interested in Manx, and they're probably more interested in Manx than nearly any other subject; it gives them a sort of pride and they take pride in it. And it's like that with adults too; a lot of people come to the classes and they regard Manx as being important as a part of their identity. The best thing about Manx is that the public are interested in Manx, or they're more interested than they once were, and it's good that there are so many classes and lessons available now and that there's a sort of structure to the classes, so it's good that everyone who is interested in Manx has a chance to learn it.","Well, Manx is thriving, certainly. We're still a long way from being safe, and we all need to do our best for Manx in the future, but there's more hope than there was. A lot of young people are coming up now who speak Manx, and they want to speak it, you know. There are people who meet up and speak Manx all the time, and not a word of English is spoken between them, and that's good. I think it's important too to find out about the older Manx, too, the Manx that's recorded in books and papers, and some of those things are coming to light now that were hidden in the Museum, and we're finding words and phrases that most people have forgotten, and I like finding out about those things and trying to spread them, and then we all, the Manx of all of us becomes richer, and I think that we can improve Manx greatly in that way in the future.
