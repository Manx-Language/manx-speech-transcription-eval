The collection features interviews and spontaneous dialogues. The speech tends to be more informal, may include overlapping speakers, hesitations, and interruptions. Background noise can vary, as some recordings occur in public or semi-controlled environments. Overall high-quality and contemporary sources, all of which are transcribed in Manx and translated into English.
