Just, that was a word. I thought that they were using words from our family, just sort of words we make up, but I- when I learned Manx I found out that it was Manx they were speaking. And I had a smattering when I was very young - Manx words. 'Cross' and 'cold', and, oh, any time I fell down and cried like that my grandmother would put her arms around me and say, ""Oh, the poor sweet little thing, the poor sweet dear,"" and everything like that, ""Poor sweet dear."" And I understood it but I didn't know it was Manx until I was much younger- older. Yeah. And my mother, she used Manx words too, just one or two, and I didn't know- I didn't think about it, I was just using Manx words sometimes. But not many, just one or two, and I didn't understand that it was Manx until I went to Manx classes and found out that I was speaking a bit of Manx."

And even to this day I can remember one word they used many times and that was the word 'rough'. Maybe they were talking about the weather - I'm not sure - but they were always saying, ""Oh, it was rough, it was rough."" And that was over sixty years ago now.

That was very interesting so we were there with Phillie for a month or two and then he was sent to Victoria Road and we had to find a new teacher. So at that time we went to Ballabeg, to the hall there, with Derek Phillips - a wonderful man and a wonderful teacher too. I can listen to Derek for hours and hours. At this time- at that time I was splitting up with my previous wife and then I had a lot of time on my hands, as they say, so I went to learn Manx in Ballabeg on Monday; in Peel with Stewie Bennett and Fiona McArdle on Tuesday, Wednesday I didn't learn Manx; Thursday I went to learn Manx in The Ship Inn in Castletown with Richard Radcliffe and Derek; and I was singing in Manx on Saturday night, so I came to be fluent pretty quickly because I wasn't doing anything else in my life!"

Anyway, up in Douglas, and Douglas Faragher taught me, and Pat Burgess the second year, taught me. And we went to Manx nights every month in the pub somewhere, and we went to the Calf - either the Calf or Eary Cushlin - for a weekend, and when we went to the Calf, every time you put a step on the boat you weren't allowed to use English until you were back on the Island. And that was very difficult to begin with very difficult, but with plenty of drink and- 'Manx through drink' I think it's called. And the same thing at Eary Cushlin. When you were through the gate you weren't allowed to use English at all. And, I think, in English they call it 'total immersion'. That was the way to do it. That's the way. It's difficult to begin with, and I remember thinking, ""I can never do this."" Men came - Johnny Crellin and people like that - and they would speak to each other in Manx and I was- I remember thinking, ""I can never do that. I can never do- be as fluent as that,"" and after six months I came to be able to do it, and that's the way to do it."

I had a sort of interest before that but I wasn't able to- there weren't classes, all the classes were in Douglas. At that time I wasn't able to drive, I didn't have much money, so it was very difficult to get to Douglas, to go on the course, it's very expensive, so, just, it wasn't happening. So after a while a class started in Ballabeg and Phillie taught that to begin with, but after a while he was busy in another place and Derek started, he was my teacher. So it just worked; I had time to read and listen, and go to Manx nights and that stuff, so I learned a lot in about three years, I think. But I don't have much time now to learn more."

It's great to see the kids from the Bunscoill using the language, just talking together in a basic way; that's very good. And I like reading and seeing Manx on the computer, and on Learn Manx, and on Youtube. It's just in a healthy state, and it's encouraging."

Now there are thousands of them. It's great, it's really great. People come to my office sometimes and they speak Manx to me and I don't know them. Once a priest came in and he said, ""Can you call a taxi for me, please?"" and I said, ""Where are you going?"" ""Ramsey."" ""And where in Ramsey?"" ""To the square in Ramsey."" And I called and found out his name, and when he said the name I thought, ""I've heard of this man."" He was the minister in a Methodist church in Ramsey, he was learning Manx, and he had a strong English accent and wonderful Manx, and I thought, ""That's how it should be."" And the school in St Johns is doing great, the Bunscoill is doing great- the thing, what's it called? The primary school for those before they go to school. Mooinjer Veggey. Mooinjer Veggey doing great things. The music that uses Manx, lots of musicians. It's not just the language but everything, the dancing, the music, the language. It's much better that I ever thought it could be when I was learning Manx. It's wonderful, fella, wonderful. And a lot of work, done by yourself, and people like you who do a lot of things. At the start they said, ""This won't work, there won't be enough people learning Manx, there aren't enough"" and now there are plenty, even people who weren't thinking of using Manx are teaching people; they learned and now they're teaching people. Wonderful."

It's a shame they're not around because, without all the work they did there wouldn't be work like mine, so we are all grateful to them, definitely, for all their work, and as I said, it's a shame they aren't here today. So things are going well, there will undoubtedly be cuts there'll be a few problems so we have to prioritise everything in the future but I think that we can do that and I'm sure that Manx will still be around for years to come and it will be much stronger."

If there are enough people in there in support of Manx we're OK, and that's the case at the moment, but that can change, and if there are enough people against Manx we might be in trouble. So far it's going well."

And I think that there are a few shops and a pub using Manx when they're working there too. I think that it's Avalon, in Douglas there, they use Manx, and in the North, Sweet Ginger, They try to speak Manx, and above all, in The Albert, they all speak Manx there. That's very important, buying drink in Manx. So I think that's it coming- there are more people- people know more about Manx now, even if they don't speak it they go, ""Isn't there a language on this island?"" So I think there's more information, that's great for the Island."

After that I went with my daughter to Carine's in Peel and there were people there and they were all speaking Manx, and the people, Mr Wade and his daughter, they speak Manx, and they say 'good afternoon' and 'how are you?' and all that. And when you say, ""How are you?"" they say, ""I'm tired,"" and the like, so that was twice I spoke Manx on Saturday. And then I was in Port Erin and I saw a woman in the street and she said, ""Good afternoon, how are you?"" That was three times in one day I spoke Manx just like this.

I am teaching, or I was teaching in the schools, and the best thing is that the children are interested in Manx, and they're probably more interested in Manx than nearly any other subject; it gives them a sort of pride and they take pride in it. And it's like that with adults too; a lot of people come to the classes and they regard Manx as being important as a part of their identity. The best thing about Manx is that the public are interested in Manx, or they're more interested than they once were, and it's good that there are so many classes and lessons available now and that there's a sort of structure to the classes, so it's good that everyone who is interested in Manx has a chance to learn it.","Well, Manx is thriving, certainly. We're still a long way from being safe, and we all need to do our best for Manx in the future, but there's more hope than there was. A lot of young people are coming up now who speak Manx, and they want to speak it, you know. There are people who meet up and speak Manx all the time, and not a word of English is spoken between them, and that's good. I think it's important too to find out about the older Manx, too, the Manx that's recorded in books and papers, and some of those things are coming to light now that were hidden in the Museum, and we're finding words and phrases that most people have forgotten, and I like finding out about those things and trying to spread them, and then we all, the Manx of all of us becomes richer, and I think that we can improve Manx greatly in that way in the future. We'll see what happens, anyway. Well, er lhiam dy vel yn Ghaelg goll dy mie ny laghyn shoh.
