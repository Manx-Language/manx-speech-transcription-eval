**Description:**  
Drawn solely from the Skeelyan Vannin (~5h 11m) recordings archive. This is also a collection of conversational interviews but this is a much less contemporary source, with the collection having been created for documentation purposes in 1948. These recordings of native speakers were made on acetate discs which have varying degrees of quality, despite considerable effort to restore them. A few recordings also include English speech intermittently and there is lots of speaker overlap. Additionally, I have been advised that a number of transcriptions are low-quality. Currently, the transcriptions only exist in PDF format, however I am working to convert these into a more structured and computer-readable format.
